The plugin can also act be used a simple\r\ntorrent-client.\r\n\r\n**Main features:**\r\n\r\n- Video torrents playback in Kodi.\r\n- Seeding after playback.\r\n- Speed, ratio and time limits for torrents.\r\n- Support for multi-file torrents - you can select individual video files for playback.\r\n- Support for magnet links, local and remote .torrent files.\r\n- Support for jump/seek to arbitrary parts of the video.\r\n\r\nSee [project's Wiki](https://github.com/romanvm/kodi.yatp/wiki) for more info.\r\n\r\n**Warning!** The plugin is in WIP state and is subject to constant changes. Proper working distributions\r\nwill be provided after it is more or less finished.\r\n\r\n**Warning 2!** To use YATP you need a binary compiled libtorrent module which is not included in the plugin.\r\nThe respective Kodi Python module addon for multiple platforms is provided in my repo along with YATP.\r\n## Basic Usage\r\nYATP can be invoked from another Kodi video plugin using the following URL:\r\n```\r\nplugin://plugin.video.yatp/?action=play&torrent=<url-encoded path to a .torrent file or a magnet link>\r\n```\r\nThis will play the biggest videofile in a torrent.\r\nThe respective list item must have its *'IsPlayable'* property set to *'true'*.\r\n\r\nShow the list of videofiles in a torrent:\r\n```\r\nplugin://plugin.video.yatp/?action=list_files&torrent=<url-encoded path to a .torrent file or a magnet link>\r\n```\r\nThis will open the list of videofiles as a Kodi virtual folder. Then you can select individual files to play.\r\n\r\nYATP also allows to play local .torrent files containing videos.\r\n## Torrent Client\r\nYATP can also be used as a simple torrent-client. It has 2 interfaces to control torrents: Kodi UI and Web UI.\r\nThe Kodi UI is available from Kodi and the Web UI can be opened using the following URL:\r\n```\r\nhttp://<Kodi hostname or IP>:8668\r\n```\r\nThe Web UI support basic operations with torrents: adding torrents for download and pausing/resuming/deleting them.\r\n\r\n**License:** [GPL v.3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).\r\n\r\nThe plugin includes [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) and [hachoir](http://hachoir3.readthedocs.org)\r\nmodules which are licensed separately by their authors.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
